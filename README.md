# Bullsmouth
Bullsmouth is an interactive video experience much like an Full Motion Video (FMV) Game, Bullsmouth is a riff on 80s and early 90s British gameshows and in particular the gameshow Bulls Eye. 
This project was created as part of a Developing Video Experiences module within the Web Technologies and Digital Media Foundation Degree offered by Blackpool and The Fylde College.
